20091023 - Mark:

	1. I removed my serial class from the src tree and placed it into a
	   separate folder labeled "Mark" in the top-level directory.

	2. I added some of John's code into the src tree. I believe that this
	   is the bare minimum that we need from John's code in order to start
	   working on the Player driver.

	3. I also wrote up a Makefile with a default "test" target that compiles John's
	   library in addition to temp.cpp, which is basically just a testing driver that
	   I'm using to test John's code.

	4. I started this Changelog which is pretty cumbersome to edit, but it's better
	   than nothing. If you have any better ideas then let me know.
