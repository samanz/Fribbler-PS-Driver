Best way is in matlab

Take a picture with your object of interest, save to pic.jpg. Open
pic.jpg in gimp or you favorite editor and cut/paste your object into
a new image.  Save that as object.jpg. Then in matlab look at the YUV
histogram of the image:

rgb = imread('object.png')
ycbcr = rgb2ycbcr(rgb)
U: imhist(ycbcr(:,:,2)) 
V: imhist(ycbcr(:,:,3))


Note the 90-95% percentiles and use those as the U/V min/maxes.
