 - Make the byte code processing  UART0/UART1 configurable 

   - So we can connect the fluke to a computer serial port
     over UART0 (the +/- 12V serial port) and grab images
     over the wired link.  Also do something useful with
     UART1 (bluetooth uart).

 - Use watchdog to reset if firmware hangs
 - Battery LED indicator should be based on timer
 - IR can be improved (working on IR communication now @ GT)

 - GET_INFO is awful - preserves backwards compatibility with
   myro (myro can use fluke by itself, a scribbler by itself, or
   a combo of both).

 - Port to iRobot Create

 - Improve camera code
 - JPEG compression of images
