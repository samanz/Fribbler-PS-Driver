Installing Player/Stage on Ubuntu

1) Go to SOURCEFORGE.NET project The Player Project

2) Download player and extract to a directory

3) Download stage and extract to a directory

4) Player/Stage has a number of projects it depends on
I found it necessary to download GIMP Toolkit 2.0 and
GNU libtool. Download these via Synaptic Package Manager.

5) cd to the directory you downloaded player and
cd into the directory that was downloaded
mine is /home/john/player/player-2.1.2

6) Now the Three Famous Commands! 

./configure

examine the output and see if that is what you want

7)
make


Often you are missing some packages so the compiles have
errors. Examine the errors to see what packages you need,
download them via Synaptic Package Manager and
go back to 5

if everything compiles you are ok.

8) sudo make install

9) go to the directory you downloaded Stage 
mine is /home/john/stage/stage-2.1.1

10) Now the Three Famous Commands again.
This time slightly different

./configure --includedir=/usr/include/gtk-2.0

check the output to see if it sounds good

11) make

check the output to see if you need more packages
if it compiles cleanly you are good

12) sudo make install


13) test it by opening two terminals and running

player /usr/local/share/stage/worlds/simple.cfg

in one terminal. A screen should pop up with a robot
in the simple world.

in the other terminal cd to your player directory

cd examples/libplayerc++
./laserobstacleavoid

and the robot should start wandering around and not
bump in to anything!
