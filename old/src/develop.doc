	All development is done on Linux and then ported to Mac OS X
and then to Windows XP. 
	Mac OS X is almost the same as Linux, the only difference is 
the port name for the bluetooth port. In both cases the environment 
variable ROBOT_ADDRESS is used to find the correct port. 
	On Linux or OS X we just run make to construct the library
and the video simulation and some example programs.
	Windows is a bit different from the Linux and OS X version.
First, we use MinGW and MSYS to approximate a Linux environment.
Second, we copy system.h.windows to system.h and ensure that the
environment variable OS has the value Windows. Make will now construct 
the library, simulation and example programs for Windows XP environment.
	The libscribbler library should compile in almost any environment
with a C++ compiler. video is dependent on SDL, SDL_image and SDL_gfx, 
which must be available on the system for video to be compiled. SDL is
implemented as DLL's on windows and these must be available for video
