 From any computer with vlc and an internet connection

     vlc http://24.45.27.1:8070

 will bring up a video, the picture you are seeing is the hallway
 outside my study, and if we are lucky you should see the Scribbler/Fluke
 robot somewhere in the picture
 On Linux and Mac computers

     ssh student@24.45.27.1

 with password "robotfun" will have you signed in to my local computer
 which can communicate with the robot
 For the moment, the best thing to do is

     ./scrib

 and the robot should start moving and printfing its sensor readings
 For Windows computers use PuTTY to establish a ssh connection
 username "student", password "robotfun".

   You can also upload programs using scp on Linux and the
 file transfer tools PSCP and PSFTP in Windows


 If anyone has some time, please try it out and send me your impressions.
 I have done a little testing from a local coffee shop and was quite pleased.
 Each part came up with only a short wait, and the video and ssh feeds
 were within a couple of seconds of each other.

	I used port forwarding on my router for port 22 (ssh) and port
8070 (video) to route these to my desktop computer. Just forwarding
TCP on port 8070 for performance. I allowed access to ports 22 and 8070
on my firewall and running the following script on my desktop

sudo chmod 666 /dev/rfcomm0
vlc v4l2:// v4l-vdev=/dev/video0 --sout="#transcode{vcodec=mp4v}:duplicate{dst=display,dst=std{access=http,mux=ogg,dst=:8070}}" --ttl 12
