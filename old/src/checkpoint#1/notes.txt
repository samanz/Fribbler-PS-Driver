General
	The Scribbler/Fluke is a combination of two very different devices. Although
there is some overlap in functionality each has it's own idiosyncratic way of dealing
with the common functionality. I did not find a way to impose a common approach and
so the interface provided explicitly represents which device we are talking to, either
the Scribbler, or the Dongle (Fluke). If there is any ambiguity the interface specifically
states which device (Scribbler or Dongle) is involved.
