The Scribbler project is in three sections.

First, libscribbler.a is a library that together with the include file scribbler.h
allow C++ programs to access the Scribbler/Fluke over the provided bluetooth link.
This library is documented in the libman document.

Second, visual is a visual simulation of a Scribbler/Fluke robot in a simple 
environment. Versions of visual exist for Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows XP.
It is intended that the student take home one of these versions in order to
gain experience in using C++ and the libscribbler interface in a relaxed environment.
Use of visual is documented in the visual document, and start.doc provides an 
introduction to libscribbler and visual.

Third, instructions are given to allow a student to remotely program a Scribbler/Fluke
and watch the results over the internet. This will allow the student limited access to
a Scribbler/Fluke outside of class.
