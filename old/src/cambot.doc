Computer has a user student with a password of robotfun

Students

 From any computer with vlc and an internet connection

     vlc http://24.45.27.1:8070

 will bring up a video, the picture you are seeing is the hallway
 outside my study, and if we are lucky you should see the Scribbler/Fluke
 robot somewhere in the picture
 On Linux and Mac computers

     ssh student@24.45.27.1

 with password "robotfun" will have you signed in to my local computer
 which can communicate with the robot
 For the moment, the best thing to do is

     ./scrib

 and the robot should start moving and printfing its sensor readings
 For Windows computers use PuTTY to establish a ssh connection
 username "student", password "robotfun".

   You can also upload programs using scp on Linux and the
 file transfer tools PSCP and PSFTP in Windows
