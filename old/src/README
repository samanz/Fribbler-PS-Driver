The Scribbler project is in three sections.

First, libscribbler.a is a library that together with the include file scribbler.h
allow C++ programs to access the Scribbler/Fluke over the provided bluetooth link.
This library is documented in the libman.odt document.

Second, video is a visual simulation of a Scribbler/Fluke robot in a simple 
environment. Versions of video exist for Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows XP.
It is intended that the student take home one of these versions in order to
gain experience in using C++ and the libscribbler interface in a relaxed environment.
Use of video is documented in the visual.odt document, and start.doc provides an 
introduction to libscribbler and video.

Third, instructions are given to allow the college to set up a system so a student can
remotely program a Scribbler/Fluke and watch the results over the internet. This will 
allow the student limited access to a Scribbler/Fluke outside of the class room setting.
The robot and webcam should be human monitored at those times that the students are 
encouraged to use this link. This should be a good job for a student as most of the 
time can be spent studing. 
This is documented in cambot.doc.

General development notes are in develop.doc.


***** Remarks:

Before you run it, you need to export the environment variable for this session as:
