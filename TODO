Test out picture taking and saving on scribbler

Fribbler Player Driver
	- Main()
		- Updating interfaces
			- Position2D
				- Calibrating the Scribbler; measuring its velocities, etc. (This is a lot of work that's time consuming, and not very interesting.)
				- Related to calibration... we need odometry!
	- ProcessMessage()
		- Interfaces
			- Position2D
				- The Scribbler is nonholonomic, so there's limited degrees of freedom
				- Basically we can only SetSpeed in a single direction, but we can also translate the yaw into a turn.
				- Probably the best movement type for the Scribbler is Carlike (speed and angle of steering)
				- Overall, we need to discuss this sometime
	- etc. (as the need arises)
