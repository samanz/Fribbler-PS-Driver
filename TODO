Test out picture taking and saving on scribbler

Fribbler Player Driver
	- Main()
		- Updating interfaces
			- Position2D
				- Calibrating the Scribbler; measuring its velocities, etc. (This is a lot of work that's time consuming, and not very interesting.)
	- ProcessMessage()
		- Interfaces
			- Position2D
				- The Scribbler is nonholonomic, so there's limited degrees of freedom
				- Basically we can only SetSpeed in a single direction, but we can also translate the yaw into a turn.
				- Probably the best movement type for the Scribbler is Carlike (speed and angle of steering)
				- Overall, we need to discuss this sometime
	- etc. (as the need arises)

	- Bluetooth LATENCY! (I think)
		- Does player provide a feedback mechanism to alert the client when the commands have been sent and acknowledged?
			For example: You want to drive for 5 seconds, so you start a clock and send the drive command. However,
			if it takes 2 seconds for the command to reach the scribbler and then act on the command, that means that
			it will only drive for 3 seconds before it's sent the command to stop (which, again, might take time to reach it).
			WE NEED A WAY TO WORK AROUND THIS SOMEHOW! As it works now, I can't get it to do anything (driving in a square,
			for example) with any kind of certainty. What can we do about this?
